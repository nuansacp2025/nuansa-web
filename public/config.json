Heartbroken and alone, the mother kneels in the twilight, praying for mercy on her own child. In answer to the prayer, lightning strikes the daughter, transforming her into a weeping stone statue. The tale serves as a cautionary reminder of a timeless truth: filial duty is not a burden but a sacred bond, and to dishonor one’s parents is to risk losing one’s own humanity.",

                        "description": "<p>The 1999 UEFA Champions League final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich stands as one of the greatest comebacks in football history. Played at Camp Nou in Barcelona, Bayern Munich took an early lead with a sixth-minute goal from Mario Basler. For most of the match, Bayern appeared to be in control, hitting the post and forcing United to defend desperately. However, in stoppage time, Manchester United's never-say-die attitude led to an incredible turnaround. Teddy Sheringham scored the equalizer in the 91st minute, followed by Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s dramatic winning goal just two minutes later. In the span of 120 seconds, Manchester United turned defeat into victory, shocking Bayern Munich and the world to win 2-1.</p><p>This triumph also completed Manchester United’s historic treble, as they had already won the Premier League and the FA Cup earlier that season. Winning the treble is one of the greatest achievements in football, a rare feat that showcases a team’s ability to dominate across multiple competitions in a single season. United's 1998-1999 team was the epitome of resilience, teamwork, and tactical brilliance under Sir Alex Ferguson. Their treble win not only solidified their place in football history but also cemented Manchester United's reputation as one of the greatest clubs in the world.</p>",
